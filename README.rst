This repository contains Overcover.  Overcover is a testing tool meant
to work in conjunction with the coverage profile data generated by the
``go test`` tool with the ``-coverprofile`` option; it computes an
overall coverage of the entire source base and emits that
information.  Overcover can also optionally enforce a minimum coverage
threshold, allowing test jobs to be failed if the testing coverage has
been weakened.
